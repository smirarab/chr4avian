This repository includes the data and scripts used in the chromosome 4 paper. Much of the data is shared with the companion paper by Stiller et al, describing the avian phylogeny. 

* The companion paper data is avilable [here](https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/ENhZODU9YE).

In this repository, we have:

* [genetreesupport](genetreesupport) includes:
    * Figures 2, E1, and E3: quartet support and monophyly across gene trees
    * Figure 1c: impact of exclusion on species tree
* [rearrangements](rearrangements) includes rearrangement analyses shown in Figure 3 and Figure E2A
  * Relies on data obtained using scripts available under [maf2synteny/](maf2synteny/) for synteny analyses
  * Relies on VGP alignemnts described under [alignment/](alignment/)
* [root-to-tip/](root-to-tip/) includes root to tip analyses, shown in Extended figure E4
* [coalHMM](coalHMM) includes coalHMM analyses shown in Figure 2 and Figure E5
* [score-columbea](score-columbea): species trees shown in Figure E7
* [selection](selection) includes selection analyses in extended figure E9
* [RYcoding-Lie](RYcoding-Lie) includes results of RY coding and Lie Markov models, explained in text
