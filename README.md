This repository includes the data and scripts used in the chromosome 4 paper. Much of the data is shared with the companion paper by Stiller et al, describing the avian phylogeny. 

* The companion paper data is available [here](https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/ENhZODU9YE).

In this repository, we have:

* [genetreesupport](genetreesupport) includes:
    * Figures 2: quartet support and monophyly across gene trees
    * Figure 3: p-values and the Manhattan plots
    * Figure 4: impact of exclusion on species tree
    * Supplementary Figures S1, S2, S4, S5, S6, S7A
* [rearrangements](rearrangements) includes rearrangement analyses shown in Figure 5 and Figure S3
  * Relies on data obtained using scripts available under [maf2synteny/](maf2synteny/) for synteny analyses
  * Relies on VGP alignments described under [alignment/](alignment/)
* [root-to-tip/](root-to-tip/) includes root-to-tip analyses, shown in Figure S7B
* [coalHMM](coalHMM) includes coalHMM analyses shown in Figure 2
* [score-columbea](score-columbea): species trees shown in Figure S9
* [selection](selection) includes selection analyses in Figure S11
* [RYcoding-Lie](RYcoding-Lie) includes results of RY coding and Lie Markov models, explained in the text
